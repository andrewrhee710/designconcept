                        <p>Notice how this website does not have a standard grid to organize the elements on the page. The web elements are unevenly spread out across the page, and headers are not in line with their respective sections that they refer to.</p>

                        <p>However, it's not just the homepage that's suffering from this bad design. Each page is set up without organization or structure, leading to awkward backgrounds and sizes that make reading the text offered a hard task.</p>

                        <p>Reading and scrolling through the website, it's clear that it was not designed to better the user's comprehension and experience. This was done as a creative choice, obvious from the purpose of the website which is to showcase the creativity of the Yale School of Art.</p>

                        <p>The header of the webpage is small and positioned in the top corner, making it hard to spot. The lack of equal structure is clearly seen with the uneven placement of elements towards the left side of the webpage. This makes it hard for the reader to search and comprehend the information placed in front of them.</p>

                        <p>This lack of a grid-based layout continues to be seen on the exhibitions page where the elements showcasing their spring gallery are not organized in a structured manner. The lack of structure makes it hard for the user to navigate the information in front of them, and it also can leave a bad impression on them.</p>

                        <p>The publication page suffers from the same lack of even structure and organization. The elements do not follow the "grid" that has been put in place by the background (notice the rectangles marked out by the individual photos), which creates a contrast between the foreground and background elements. This can put more strain on the user's eyes and make processing information harder.</p>
